# Key Improvements Made

1. Class-Based Architecture

All methods now have access to vendor_names, id_list, and owner_df
Utility functions are shared between draft and executed pipelines
Draft vs executed logic is cleanly separated but inherits from the same base

1.3 Configuration Section at Top

`EXCEL_PATH:` Set your vendor spreadsheet path once here
`HEADER_ROW:` Configure which row contains headers (0-indexed)
Column name variables (`VENDOR_COLUMN`, `ID_COLUMN`, `OWNER_COLUMN`) that can be changed in one place

1.6. Automatic Sheet Selection

Now automatically uses the first sheet in the Excel file
No need to specify sheet name in command line

1.9. Simplified Functionality

Removed all single-file processing code
Focused entirely on batch processing
Cleaner command-line interface

```bash
# Preview mode (default - shows what would be renamed)
python document_renamer.py /path/to/directory --status executed

# Actually rename files
python document_renamer.py /path/to/directory --status executed --rename

# Process only PDF files
python document_renamer.py /path/to/directory --status executed --pattern "*.pdf"

# Process draft Word documents
python document_renamer.py /path/to/directory --status draft --pattern "*.docx"
```

3. Enhanced Fuzzy Matching

The PDF pipeline now has full access to fuzzy matching
Improved vendor guessing with better ignore patterns
Consistent ID matching across both pipelines

4. Better Error Handling & User Experience

Preview mode shows before/after comparison
Batch processing capabilities
Verbose/quiet modes for debugging
Clear error messages with suggestions

5. Modular Design

Each major function has a single responsibility
Easy to extend with new document types
Clear debugging output that can be toggled

6. Fixed the "Executed" Definition Issue

The distinction between drfat and executed is now explicit:

- Draft: Uses file modification date, includes owner initials

- Executed: Extracts dates from PDF content, no initials (assumes final document)
