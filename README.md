# Key Improvements Made

1. Class-Based Architecture

All methods now have access to vendor_names, id_list, and owner_df
Utility functions are shared between draft and executed pipelines
Draft vs executed logic is cleanly separated but inherits from the same base

2. Command Line Interface

```bash
# Single file with preview
python src\document_renamer.py --excel vendors.xlsx --file "contract.pdf" --status executed --preview

# Batch preview
python src\document_renamer.py --excel vendors.xlsx --directory "/path/to/docs" --status draft --preview

# Interactive mode
python src\document_renamer.py --excel vendors.xlsx --status executed
```

3. Enhanced Fuzzy Matching

The PDF pipeline now has full access to fuzzy matching
Improved vendor guessing with better ignore patterns
Consistent ID matching across both pipelines

4. Better Error Handling & User Experience

Preview mode shows before/after comparison
Batch processing capabilities
Verbose/quiet modes for debugging
Clear error messages with suggestions

5. Modular Design

Each major function has a single responsibility
Easy to extend with new document types
Clear debugging output that can be toggled

6. Fixed the "Executed" Definition Issue

The distinction between drfat and executed is now explicit:

- Draft: Uses file modification date, includes owner initials

- Executed: Extracts dates from PDF content, no initials (assumes final document)
